title: Kumite
---

Kumite is a long running experiment on Codewars to see what happens when Codewarriors "spar" with each other.

## What is Kumite?

In karate, kumite (ko͞omiˌtā) is the practice of taking techniques learned from kata and applying them through the act of freestyle sparring.
Continuing with the coding dojo theme, and the already well established concept of a code kata,
we wanted to play the idea of what a code kumite would look like within the Codewars community.
It is a social experiment to see how developers could share ideas and then respond to them with code instead of just words.

## How does it work?

Creating a new kumite will involve creating some code, with an optional description and set of test cases that prove it works.
Once published, the code provided will be considered the first "move".
You and any other code warrior are then able to respond to that move with your own.
You do this by "forking" the original move.
Your fork can refactor the original code, add features, fix bugs, add additional tests, etc.
Any fork can then also be forked, creating a series of moves that happen between 1 or more participants.

## What do I use this for?

Lots of things really.
You could show off something you learned, only to have others show you an even more efficient way of doing the same thing.
Maybe you have discovered an interesting and experimental design pattern in your favorite language and want to show it off,
where others could then expand on the idea.
You could use it for teaching - Kata are great for well defined problems,
but when a solution is open to many interpretations you could allow your students to experiment with how they would approach it in their own way.

To be honest we really don't know what it's good for yet, at this point it's still just an experiment.
Our take on what a code kata would look like within an open community was an experiment as well,
that has turned out to be a success.
What makes kata work is the amazing community behind them. All of you contribute by authoring,
translating and solving kata - allowing others to learn from you.
Just like kata, it will be up to the community to turn kumite into something great.

We look forward to seeing what the Codewars community comes up with! How would you utilize this format for something interesting?

(About)

Kumite (ko͞omiˌtā) is the practice of taking techniques learned from Kata and applying them through the act of freestyle sparring.

You can create a new kumite by providing some initial code and optionally some test cases.
From there other warriors can spar with you, by enhancing, refactoring and translating your code.
There is no limit to how many warriors you can spar with.
