Congrats on completing your first kata! Here are some tips for what to do now.

### Solutions

Each time you complete a kata you will be shown the solution of other Codewarriors.
This is a great way to pick up new tips and tricks.

### Next Kata

You can move on to the next kata by clicking this button in the top right corner.
It will randomly select a new kata for you based off of your selected language and training routine.
Your active training routing is found on the dashboard page if you want to change it.

### Train Again

If the kata is available in another language that you know or are interested in, try to complete it again in that language.

### Discourse

If you have something to say about the kata you just took,
you can head over to the discourse section to chat about it.
