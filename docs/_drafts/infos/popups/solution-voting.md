title: Solution Voting
---

You can vote on other Codewarrior's solutions to help uncover the best ones.

There are 2 choices for voting:

## Best Practices

Best practices are for solutions that you think are a good combination of being maintainable and efficient.
They may not be the fastest solution - if the fastest solution involves overly optimizing the code in a way that becomes hard to read.

## Clever

Clever votes are for solutions that you feel like are notable in some way, but not something you would expect to see in production code.
