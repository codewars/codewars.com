Welcome to the kata discourse.
Anyone can leave comments.
If you need help you can post the code you are struggling with and mark it as a "spoiler" so that only those who have completed the kata can see it.

If you wish to log an issue about this specific kata,
such as poorly worded descriptions or issues with test cases,
then you can leave a comment.
Before posting the comment, make sure to mark it as a suggestion or an issue.
